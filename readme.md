# Riley's Dotfiles

A simple collection of my personal dot files. Much credit for many of these goes to:

* dot files - [Mathiasbynes/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
* tmux - [dwmkerr/dotfiles](https://github.com/dwmkerr/dotfiles/blob/main/tmux/tmux.conf)

## Setup
Run the following command to setup easily and properly. 
```
. ./setup.sh
```
